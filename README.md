Our app will cover the following features:
1.	This app enables people to let the rescuers know about the status of food availability in their area, the number of people trapped and their respective locations. These locations would be the main targets of the rescuers to supply them with the basic amenities of life.
2.	These targets would be shown on map and both the trapped individual and rescuers would be able to see this.
3.	This allows the individuals who were detached from their group to find these targets and try to get there if possible as soon as possible.
4.	The trapped individuals can upload photos and videos to give more information to the rescuers about their live status.
5.	The rescuers can then act accordingly where to help and how much to help depending upon the group size and food availability.
6.	Obviously, there would we separate login buttons for the trapped individual and the rescuer which allows them to access separate app interfaces.
7.	This apps also allows to make emergency call for help for any injured person who is in serious condition.
8.	This area’s which requires immediate medical attention will be marked red on the map and special notification with red alert will be send to the rescuers.
